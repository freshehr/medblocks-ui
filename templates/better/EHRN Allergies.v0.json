A substance may be a compound of simpler substances, for example a medicinal product. If the value in 'Substance' is an individual substance and not a substance class, then it may be duplicated in this data element. It is strongly recommended that 'Specific substance' be coded with a terminology capable of triggering decision support, where possible.  For example: RxNorm, Snomed CT, DM+D, NDFRT, ICD-9, ICD-10, UNI, ATC and CPT. Free text entry should only be used if there is no appropriate terminology available.",
